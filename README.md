I'm building crash-test dummies for AI at [Circuit Breaker Labs](https://www.circuitbreakerlabs.ai/).

Previously, I:
* Developed AI-based graph analytics tools for defense and intel applications at a [boutique prime](https://globalinfotek.com/)
* Invested in semiconductors at a [hedge fund](https://point72.com/)
* Worked on strategy at a [space domain awareness startup](https://hyperios.com/)

I've also researched [dual-use startup funding](https://repository.digital.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/1101032) and [algorithmic bias in mortgage lending](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wv-2oA8v9dSkIqMM168l6KIJ3VlqPKJk/view), and designed a [blockchain-based voting system](https://www.teknos.org/home/2021/3/31/electoral-fraud-blocked-amp-chained-design-of-a-novel-secure-cryptographic-amp-blockchain-based-voting-architecture?rq=nigam).

I studied Operations & Analytics + Global Business at [Georgetown](https://www.georgetown.edu/). In college, I:
* Led a [100+ person organization](https://georgetownstudentcapital.com/) that raised $250k+ for startups and conducted due diligence for PE/VC firms ($12b+ collective AUM)
* Chaired the supervisory committee of the [largest student-run financial institution](https://www.guasfcu.com/) ($20m+ in assets)

Before that, I was in the Computer Systems Lab at [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology). In high school, I:
* Fed 2,500+ frontline workers at 56 hospitals across 21 states through the [Heroes of COVID](https://www.heroesofcovidinitiative.com/) initiative—I was even interviewed on [Live with Kelly and Ryan](https://youtu.be/0am_DAaUhcQ?si=ysFXc-ScW3taWoBr)!
* Helped pass the bipartisan [FASTER Act](https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/546602-passage-of-faster-act-is-critical-for-food-allergy-community/) and create the [Congressional Food Allergy Research Caucus](https://www.foodallergy.org/media-room/fare-applauds-creation-congressional-food-allergy-research-caucus)
* Authored a [book on contrarian thinking](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LVGGWZP) that made Amazon’s top ten political short reads

I'm also a deal partner at [Boardy](https://www.boardy.ai/), the world's first AI-led venture fund. If you're building something cool, [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arul-nigam/)!
